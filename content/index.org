*I study how knowledge is made useful --- or not.* The history of environmental bureaucracy and social science is full of unexpected continuities and discontinuities. I think through them in my scholarship and through public service.

In my research, I examine two major cases of public knowledge in the 20th century United States, sociology and the Federal air pollution control technocracy. My book on the origins of air pollution control is under advance contract in the /Middle Range/ series with Columbia University Press.

My students and I at the Queens Data Lab apply findings from my research to help local public organizations make sense of their work. If you are a public organization in Queens NYC with data lying around, get in touch.

* other stuff :noexport:

My theoretical and methodological work searches for new ways to frame computation, history, and sociology as elements in a broader tradition in humanist and political thought. I bring this to my teaching in data analytics, which combines analog and digital computing with discussions on the history and epistemology of statistics.
